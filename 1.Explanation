In web development, particularly when working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), two common HTTP methods are POST and GET. Both are used to send and retrieve data from a web server, but they have distinct purposes and behaviors.

GET Method
Purpose: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. When a client sends a GET request, it asks the server to send back some data.
Characteristics:
Data sent with a GET request is appended to the URL as query parameters.
It's considered safe and idempotent (meaning repeated requests have the same effect as a single request).
GET requests can be cached, and they are also bookmarkable.
Common Use Cases: Fetching data, such as retrieving user profiles, search results, etc.
