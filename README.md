# Get-Method
GET Method in Web Development
The GET method is used by the client (such as a web browser) to request data from a server. It is one of the most common HTTP methods and is primarily used to retrieve information without causing any side effects on the server.

How GET Works:
Request Initiation:
When a user navigates to a webpage or clicks a link, their browser sends a GET request to the server asking for specific data (like an HTML page, JSON data, images, etc.).

Data Retrieval:
The server processes this request and responds with the requested data, such as a webpage, API data, or images.

No Data Change:
GET requests are read-only; they do not modify data on the server. They are safe and idempotent (repeating the request has the same effect as doing it once).

Parameters (Optional):
GET requests can include parameters in the URL (called query strings), which specify filters or options for the data requested. For example:
https://example.com/api/books?author=Harper+Lee

Key Characteristics:
Used for data retrieval
Parameters are in URL (visible in address bar)
Safe and idempotent (does not change server state)
Limited data size (URLs have length limits)
The server responds with the list of books in JSON format, which the frontend then displays to the user.
In Summary:
The GET method is essential for fetching and displaying data in web applications. It allows users to see information without changing anything on the server.
